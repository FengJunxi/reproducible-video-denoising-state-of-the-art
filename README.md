# reproducible-video-denoising-state-of-the-art
Collection of popular and reproducible image denoising works.

Criteria: works must have codes available, and the reproducible results demonstrate promising or state-of-the-art performances for video denoising.

This format of the collection is similar to [reproducible-image-denoising](https://github.com/wenbihan/reproducible-image-denoising-state-of-the-art)

Note: The first part of this repo includes Gaussian noise removal, and later will include more works for handling other noise distribution or real noise.
